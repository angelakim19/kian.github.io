        To My Dearest Kian,</p>
      
        <p class="ty2">I hope this letter finds you smiling. Happy Heart's Day, red-flag guy! HAHAHAHA. Anyway, I hope your day went well, and you're ready for your exam tomorrow. I am happy, yet a bit scared, about meeting and being with you. Happy because even though you're a total red flag, you have had an impact and imparted valuable values to me, which helped me widen my perspective, continue to learn, and grow. It may not all be about the good aspect, but you opened up and made me realize that the world is big for me to explore responsibly.</p>

        <p class="ty3">I am a bit scared about how this BFF promax will end up. Nevertheless, I am not bothered that much since every time I am with you, I always cherish it. I've noticed you're a good guy; maybe there are some lapses you always pinpoint, but I see several green flags in you (no cap). You deserve the things you've been withholding for yourself; hopefully, soon you'll realize that.</p>

        <p class="ty4">I want you to know that we may be less as lovers and more than friends; you can always count on me if you need anything. I will have no second thoughts or doubts about being with you whenever you need me. I am always rooting and praying for you to have a successful career and a good life. God Bless tomorrow and happy heart's day!!</p>
